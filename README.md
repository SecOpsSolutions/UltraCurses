### What is this?

Ever wanted to build fancy "graphical", interactive user interfaces in your C++ terminal Linux application? If so you probably tried to work yourself into [ncurses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncurses) and probably gave up at one point into development. However it might be, this project tries to be a more convenient way of using ncurses in C++ terminal applications.

### How do i start

1.  git clone
2.  make all
3.  bin/demo, bin/snake
